Concepts:

- cve.mitre.org's CVEs
- CVE tickets
- advisory tickets
- mdv advisories MDVSAs

Tasks that could be implemented in sekt:

- create CVE tickets
- create "advisory for $package" tickets, bind (using Depends or Blocks)
  CVEs automatically
- automatically generate advisory messages based on the messages from the
  CVEs associated in each advisory ticket
- bind advisory tickets to MDVSA (or MDVAs) numbers
- bind stable kernel releases with CVE fixes (in order to ease generating
  the kernel update changelog)

What it can't do:

- run mkadvisory!
